# Storing tasks in a collection

{{> step03CollectionsIntro}}

Let's update our JavaScript code to get our tasks from a collection instead of a static array:

```js
// simple-todos.js
Tasks = new Mongo.Collection("tasks");

if (Meteor.isClient) {
  // This code only runs on the client
  Template.body.helpers({
    tasks: function () {
      return Tasks.find({});
    }
  });
}
```

When you make these changes to the code, you'll notice that the tasks that used to be in the todo list have disappeared. That's because our database is currently empty &mdash; we need to insert some tasks!
